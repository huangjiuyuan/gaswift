# Genetic Algorithm with Lyrics

This is a simple implementation of genetic algorithm, with a target of writing the best lyrics in the world.

## How to Run

This program is written in Go. To set up a Go environment, just Google it. If you were as lazy as me, you could click [here](https://golang.org/).

To start getting the best lyrics in the world, please run:
```
go run cmd/main.go
```

If you do not like Taylor Swift, you can set the best lyrics in the world by your self, like this:
```
go run cmd/main.go I used to rule the world. Seas would rise when I gave the word.
```
